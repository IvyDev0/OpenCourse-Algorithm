## week 1: Percolation (100/100)
http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html

Short Summary:
1. Found the the general model of Union Find easy but pretty interesting. The basic methology behind: Model the problem, start with a simple solution, figure out its performance characteristics, which help improve the algorithm. 
3. The 'virtual site' is a nice trick, reducing the searching time from O(N^2) to O(1). Yet more space is needed.
2. Found useful tools to check the style of programs and identify common bug patterns: Findbugs, PMD, and Checkstyle.
